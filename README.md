# Flanking Zone Field of Battle (FZFOB) Chess

**FZFOB Chess** is a new 10×10 chess variant that builds on the rules of classical chess and Chess960. It introduces a surrounding “Flanking Zone” that only knights can enter, expanding the board without overcomplicating the game. The result is a tactically rich variant with new opening dynamics, creative mobility, and minimal rule changes.

## 📌 Variant Summary

- The game is played on a **10×10 board**.
- The inner **8×8 grid** (a1–h8) is the **Field of Battle (FOB)**, where all traditional rules apply.
- The surrounding ring (files `α` and `ω`, and ranks `0` and `9`) is the **Flanking Zone**, accessible **only by knights**.
- All **non-knight pieces** must remain inside the FOB at all times.
- Opening theory expands: **26 legal opening moves**, up from 20 in classical chess.
- **Notation extension** uses Greek letters and zero-based ranks for clarity and engine friendliness.

## 🧠 Strategic Features

- **Flank-first options:** Knights can open games by jumping into the Flanking Zone, creating new threats or positioning.
- **Enhanced Na3/Nh3 ideas:** Previously dubious corner knight moves become gateways to broader maneuvering.
- **Simplified rule changes:** No modifications to classical piece rules; just one geographic restriction.
- **Engine-friendly design:** 10×10 board supports clean 0-based indexing, minimal encoding adjustments.
