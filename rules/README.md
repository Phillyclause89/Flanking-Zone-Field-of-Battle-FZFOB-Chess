# 📜 FZFOB Chess – Rules Overview

This document outlines the core rules of **Flanking Zone Field of Battle (FZFOB) Chess**, a 10×10 chess variant that introduces a Flanking Zone accessible exclusively to knights. The variant maintains the fundamental mechanics of classical chess while expanding strategic possibilities.

## 🧩 Board Structure

- **Total Board**: 10×10 grid.
- **Field of Battle (FOB)**: Central 8×8 grid (files a–h, ranks 1–8) where all standard chess rules apply.
- **Flanking Zone**:
  - **Files**: `θ` (left flank) and `χ` (right flank).
  - **Ranks**: `0` (bottom flank) and `9` (top flank).
  - Only **knights** may enter or move through these squares.

## ♟ Piece Movement

- **Knights**: Can move freely between the FOB and Flanking Zone using standard L-shaped moves.
- **Other Pieces**: Must remain within the FOB at all times.
- **Pawns**: Cannot move into the Flanking Zone (unless they promote to a knight?!); promotions occur within the FOB.

## 🏁 Game Rules

- **Check, Checkmate, and Stalemate**: Follow classical rules within the FOB. (Any adjacent Flanking Zone squares need not be controlled, as the king cannot leave the FOB.)
- **Castling**: Permitted only within the FOB; king and rook cannot pass through or land on Flanking Zone squares.
- **Draw Conditions**: Same as classical chess, including the 50-move rule and threefold repetition. (To Be Researched: Certain rare knight configurations may achieve forced mate in FZFOB due to restricted king movement.)
